The purpose of this package is to enable Arch Linux users to generate PBA(Pre Boot Authentification) UEFI64 images
(with all the features of mkinitcpio like adding extra binaries).
This image can then be used to unlock OPAL SED drive and reboot so that the real operating system can be loaded.

Required software:
- linux headers
- mkinitcpio (will be probably changed in the future)
- base-devel package on arch linux (gcc, make, patch)
- git
- bc
- xz for compression (optional, used by default)
- mmd, mcopy from mtools package
- mkfs.vfat from dosfstools package
- grub-mkimage from grub2 package
- sfdisk from gptfdisk package
- dd from util-linux package

Usage:
- edit Makefile (the relevant parts are commented) and run make.
- flash build/pba.img on usb stick and boot from it to test if it works (just edit TEST_DEVICE variable in Makefile and run "make test")
- edit OPAL_DEVICE and OPAL_PASSWORD variables and run make install to install build/pba.img as a pre boot image.

Current Issues:
- I don't know if the users of Linux kernel < 4.4 need the nvme_admin_cmd.patch applied. Erase patch applying step in makefile it if you get nvme_* error.
  It is under "$(BUILD_DIR)/sedutil:" make target, just after "git clone" step. As of now it's on line 74.
- using UUID doesn't quite work because the grub root device is not found at early grub config. You can however get past this step in grub shell
  if you do "ls" and then set root="correct device" and then use "configfile /grub/grub.cfg" command.
  Alternatively if you are trying to run from usb stick with UUID mode, try executing "configfile (usb0,gpt1)/grub/grub.cfg" or use "ls" command to found out the correct device.
  I advise to use LABEL method for now (the default).
